Hi, I'm Marcus. 

- Iâ€™m currently working at [Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, CO](https://www.boulder.swri.edu/). 
- My main priority is developing the Science Operations Center data reduction pipeline for [PUNCH](https://punch.space.swri.edu/), an upcoming NASA mission to study the solar environment. [Watch our code get released!](https://github.com/punch-mission)
- I'm also interested in machine learning applications in solar physics. 
- I'm learning Rust. 
- I'm growing a [digital garden called Arbor](https://arbor.jmbhughes.com) to learn in public.
