Hi, I'm Marcus. 

- I am a Senior Computer Scientist at the [Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, CO](https://www.boulder.swri.edu/). 
- One of my main priorities is developing the Science Operations Center data reduction pipeline for [PUNCH](https://punch.space.swri.edu/), an upcoming NASA mission to study the solar environment. [Watch our code get released!](https://github.com/punch-mission)
- I am extending what I've learned with PUNCH to create the data reduction pipeline for the [CubIXSS mission](https://github.com/CubIXSS). 
- I'm interested in machine learning applications in solar physics, with specific experience in [thematic maps](https://www.swsc-journal.org/articles/swsc/pdf/2019/01/swsc180074.pdf). I'm working on an improved version called [CORD Maps](https://github.com/jmbhughes/cordmap).
- I'm also exploring detection algorithms for microflares. 
- In my spare time, I made [Barnsley, a Rust app to explore iterated function systems,](https://github.com/jmbhughes/barnsley) with a [web-based GUI](https://jmbhughes.com/barnsley_gui/). It was a great introduction to Rust.
- Now, I'm making Compass, a notetaking app in Rust with graphs of notes being a core concept.
